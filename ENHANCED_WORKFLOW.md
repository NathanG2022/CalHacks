# Enhanced CalHacks Workflow: User Prompts + Letta RAG + HuggingFace + Strategy Tracking

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Overview

```
User Input Prompt
       â†“
   Letta RAG Agent (Retrieves relevant strategies)
       â†“
   Strategy Optimizer (Applies successful patterns)
       â†“
   HuggingFace Model (Generates canary token)
       â†“
   Success Detection (Checks for canary)
       â†“
   Strategy Learning (Updates success patterns)
       â†“
   Results & Analytics (Stored in Supabase)
```

## ðŸ”§ Components

### 1. **Strategy Tracker** (Supabase)
- Stores successful prompt patterns
- Tracks success rates by strategy type
- Maintains user-specific strategy preferences
- Provides analytics and insights

### 2. **Letta RAG Agent**
- Retrieves relevant strategies from knowledge base
- Contextualizes user prompts with historical data
- Provides strategy recommendations

### 3. **HuggingFace Integration**
- Supports custom models from HuggingFace Hub
- Handles different model types (text generation, classification)
- Manages API keys and rate limiting

### 4. **Prompt Optimizer**
- Applies successful strategies to user prompts
- Combines multiple strategies intelligently
- Learns from feedback and success patterns

### 5. **Canary Detection System**
- Detects canary tokens in model outputs
- Supports multiple canary formats
- Provides confidence scores

## ðŸ“Š Data Flow

1. **User submits prompt** â†’ Frontend
2. **Retrieve strategies** â†’ Letta RAG queries strategy database
3. **Optimize prompt** â†’ Apply successful patterns
4. **Generate response** â†’ HuggingFace model processes optimized prompt
5. **Detect canary** â†’ Check output for success indicators
6. **Update strategies** â†’ Learn from success/failure
7. **Return results** â†’ User sees response + strategy info

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience

- **Input**: User types their prompt
- **Processing**: System shows "Applying strategies..." 
- **Output**: Generated response with canary token
- **Insights**: Shows which strategies were used and their success rates
- **Learning**: System gets smarter over time

## ðŸ”„ Strategy Learning

- **Success Tracking**: Records which strategies work for which prompt types
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common successful combinations
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Adjusts strategy selection based on user patterns
- **A/B Testing**: Tries different approaches and learns from results
